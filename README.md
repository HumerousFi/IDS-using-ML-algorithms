Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning

Overview

In the modern digital era, cybersecurity threats are increasing at an alarming rate. Our Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leverages machine learning to identify and prevent unauthorized access attempts, ensuring network security against cyber threats.

Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a predictive model capable of distinguishing between normal network connections and malicious intrusions, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and probing activities.

Key Features

Real-time Intrusion Detection: Monitors and classifies network traffic.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements multiple classification techniques.

Comprehensive Dataset: Uses the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.

Detailed Analysis: Evaluates model performance across various metrics.

Scalability: Designed for adaptation to real-world network security systems.

Attack Categories

The IDS detects and classifies attacks into four main categories:

Denial-of-Service (DoS): Flooding the network to make services unavailable.

Remote-to-Local (R2L): Unauthorized remote access attempts.

User-to-Root (U2R): Privilege escalation attacks.

Probing: Scanning for vulnerabilities and weak points.

Dataset Used

We utilize the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset for evaluating IDS performance. It contains various network traffic records, each labeled as normal or an attack type.

Machine Learning Models

To achieve accurate intrusion detection, we apply and compare the following models:

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

Implementation Approach

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset.

Feature Selection: Extracting relevant network traffic features.

Model Training: Applying machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation & Optimization: Comparing results and improving accuracy.

Deployment & Monitoring: Future integration into real-world systems.
